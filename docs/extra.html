<p>Are you having some trouble working with the machines or making products? Are you stuck or need assistance? There are a few useful ways and places to find help from the Precious Plastic team or community.</p>
<p>Website</p>
<p>Our website is a good place to start. There you can find a lot of information, video tutorials, documentation and tips on how to run a Precious Plastic workspace. Go to www.preciousplastic.com and start browsing to gather more knowledge on the topic. Studying the website and videos in deep will give you the basic knowledge to find help and talk about plastic on the forum with other people around the world.</p>
<p>Forum</p>
<p>The forum is the place to go to find answers to more complex questions. The forum is where our community and fellow recyclers meet and try to find answers to their questions. Over the years the place has evolved into a useful (and extensive!) resource for people working on Precious Plastic with lots of helpful knowledge and hundreds of specific topics on our machines and methods. Most of your questions (especially in the beginning) have probably already been tackled on the forum, make sure you dig deep in the forums to find your answers. If you still can’t find what you’re looking for you can post a new topic and wait for a reply.</p>
<p>Map</p>
<p>The map can be a great source of inspiration. There you can find more people working on Precious Plastic around the world (maybe near you!). The map showcases people that built machines, set up shops, sell &amp; fix machines and make products. You can contact people directly if you have questions or want to get in contact. <a class="reference external" href="http://map.preciousplastic.com">http://map.preciousplastic.com</a></p>
<p>Youtube</p>
<p>Yes, you’ve heard it right. Youtube is a great learning platform where a lot of knowledgeable people explain stuff in great details. At Precious Plastic we often refer to Youtube to troubleshoot and find solutions to our plastic problems. Give it a try, it’s fun!</p>
<p>Local guy</p>
<p>Often if you’re looking for more technical and hands-on expertise when it comes to moulds or metal in general a local metal worker in town would be a great place to start. They are usually very experienced and knowledgeable on the topic and can offer greater explanation than any other digital sources.</p>
<p>Updates</p>
<p>Precious Plastic is in constant evolution, we keep improving our machines and techniques to fight plastic pollution. Precious Plastic evolves in versions, meaning that every year or two we release a new version with new features for the machines, products, tutorials, websites, collaborative tools and the forum to make Precious Plastic more efficient, relevant and increase our impact. If you regularly check www.preciousplastic.com you can make sure to be up to date with the latest developments of the project.</p>

<div class="section" id="activate-your-community">
<h2>Activate your community<a class="headerlink" href="#activate-your-community" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The more people are involved in the project the more plastic will be recycled and reused, helping to solve the environmental and health issues connected to plastic pollution across the planet. Precious Plastic is about inclusive collaboration and builds upon sharing knowledge and tools between friends, family, neighbours, cities, countries and nations. Don’t hold your knowledge, offer what you’ve learnt and know about plastic with the international community of recyclers so that we can work together to fix this problem. Create workshops, open days, visits, training, school days and events around the Precious Plastic workspace to involve an ever greater portion of society around you to educate and learn about plastic, how to work with it and how to create amazing new products from discarded plastic. Share your learnings, experiments or failed tests back with the community so more people can learn from you or help you to improve and overcome your difficulties.</p>
<p>You are now part of the Precious Plastic global family!</p>

<div class="section" id="feedback">
<h2>Feedback<a class="headerlink" href="#feedback" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We understand this is the boring part. However, this is also one of the most important part of the project. If we learn from your opinions, experiences and problems we can improve Precious Plastic for you and for the next people working on this. The problem you will encounter, misunderstandings, inconsistencies, unclear descriptions or stuff that just feels like it could be improved is all super valuable feedback material for us to fix issues and grow better, together. In a hot sunny day or while waiting for a bus we would love if you could take the time to write us an email or post a topic on the forum with feedback on the project.</p>
